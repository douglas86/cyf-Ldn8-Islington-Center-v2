# Looking for Help?

We work with asylum seekers, refugees and migrants from all over the world offering English classes, practical support and community. We welcome people regardless of where they come from, their immigration status, their age, their religion, their background or any other factor.

We work with registered clients only – this way we are able to offer a high level of support, finding out exactly what each person needs from us and helping them with that.

## High demand means that our register is full at the moment.

If you are interested in our services, either for yourself or for a friend, we ask you to register for our waiting list.

To register for the waiting list please fill in Form 1 below, and you will automatically be placed on the waiting list and notified when we have space.

<!-- Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started. -->
